### REST API plugins for phpList

This repository contains two separate API plugins for phpList, the REST API Plugin v1 and v2. 

v1 is no longer maintained and, while functional, should be considered depreciated.
v2 is under active development and should be used and extended where possible.

Both plugins are contained within the `plugins` folder, along with respective documentation and plugin-specific tests.
